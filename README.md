# Ender Dragon Fight Remastered: Create(D) Edition

This is Diamond Drake Venture's fork of [Ender Dragon Fight Remastered] v5.0.

DDV uses Ender Dragon Fight Remastered in the [Create(D)] modpack.
Since the modpack is on Minecraft 1.21.1, we needed to backport EDF v5.0.
We also tweaked some mechanics of the fight to better suit our use case.

You're welcome to use this fork under [the same terms we are](LICENSE) but we will not be
supporting any use cases outside of the Create(D) modpack.
If you are a player of the modpack, please submit your issues to the pack's issue tracker.

We do not accept outside contributions.
Consider submitting your contribution to the upstream project instead.

As with upstream, music is by [Solunary] and [DM Dokuro].

## Changes from upstream

- ~~Backported Minecraft 1.21 to 1.21.6 while remaining compatible with 1.21.7 to 1.21.8.
  We have submitted this change as a [PR] to upstream.~~
  Our [PR] has been merged with upstream.
- Equalized and normalized BGM.
  Phase 2 BGM is louder so we've set it to 50% of the Phase 1 BGM.
- Ads die after the Dragon dies.
- Dragon is invulnerable when the miniboss is active.
